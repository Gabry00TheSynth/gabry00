My school is TEB Technikum located in Wroc≈Çaw, I am currently in class 3Tei (IT Technician & ESPORTS), I know a lot about desktop computers or creating
local network areas.
<br><br />
I am a big fan of Esports, especially in League of Legends. I know every team in LEC (League European Championship) or every team that won World Championships
in this game.
<br><br />
I can tell you something about my classes in school or exams:
<br><br />
- First class: 1Tei
<br><br />
- Second class: 2Tei
<br><br />
- Third class: 3Tei (Right now I am in this class)
<br><br />


<br><br />
I've also had some trial exams:
<br><br />
- Theoretical = 60%
<br><br />
- Practical part 1 (Administration of Operating Systems) = 96%
<br><br />
- Practical part 2 (Operation of Local Computer Networks) = 92%
<br><br />
- Practical part 3 (Operation of Computer Technology Devices) = 100%
<br><br />

That's it for now! Thank you for everything! :3
